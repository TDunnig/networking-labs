## Lab 1: Configure Logging in pfSense

**Video:** https://www.loom.com/share/9545b733a5ba4d90a70ef89d7f59f06f

In this lab, we're configuring some sys logs and we're capturing them from the firewall in pfSense.

### Topics Covered:
- Syslog configuration
- System log capture
- Firewall logging
- pfSense logging setup

- ## Lab 2: Evaluate Event Logs in pfSense for Potential Attack

**Video:** https://www.loom.com/share/421e8565a4e74137a3f16c3823edac92

In this lab, we perform passive recon on your network using pfSense logging capabilities. You are concerned attackers may be attempting to gain access to your network. We examine logs to see if on-path attacks have occurred.

### Topics Covered:
- Network passive reconnaissance
- pfSense logging capabilities
- Log analysis for security threats
- On-path attack detection
- Threat identification in firewall logs

- ## Lab 3: Implement Snort on pfSense pt.2

**Video:** https://www.loom.com/share/c70acdaf3ddc4569b549e2c8e80ae2f3

In this lab, we go back and troubleshoot a mistake to include the right time in global settings.

### Topics Covered:
- Snort implementation on pfSense
- Configuration troubleshooting
- Global settings configuration
- Time synchronization in Snort

- ## Lab 4: Implement Snort on pfSense pt.1

**Video:** https://www.loom.com/share/c3b0cca2351841d2b6191fec4ac0cd47

In this lab, we implement Snort on pfSense. Snort is an IDS/IPS (Intrusion Detection System and Intrusion Prevention System) that monitors network traffic for suspicious activity.

### Topics Covered:
- Snort IDS/IPS implementation
- pfSense Snort integration
- Intrusion detection setup
- Intrusion prevention configuration

## Lab 5: Enabling Logging on Cisco Switches for IT Security

**Video:** https://www.loom.com/share/81cffb7e6aa147db9dabc5a8a0f7265c

In this lab, you're an IT security administrator for a small corporate network. We enable logging on the switch in the network closet and configure a syslog aggregator to centralize log collection.

### Topics Covered:
- Cisco switch logging configuration
- Syslog aggregator setup
- Network security monitoring
- Centralized log management
- IT security best practices

## Lab 6: Exploring Nmap for Port Scanning and Vulnerability Assessment

**Video:** https://www.loom.com/share/962af17ff21b4131af88a34a99372dfe

In this lab, we explore Nmap skills and use Zenmap, the GUI version of Nmap, to perform port scanning and vulnerability assessment on networks.

### Topics Covered:
- Nmap port scanning
- Zenmap GUI usage
- Vulnerability assessment
- Network reconnaissance
- Port discovery and analysis


## Lab 7: Troubleshooting Internet Connectivity in Office 2

**Video:** https://www.loom.com/share/aef5bbe68c5a46f6b1cc3f0c32d22cbb

In this lab, Office 2 does not have internet access. We determine what IP addresses are currently assigned, troubleshoot the connectivity issue, and restore internet access to the office.

### Topics Covered:
- Network connectivity troubleshooting
- IP address assignment verification
- Internet access diagnostics
- Network reconfiguration
- Connectivity restoration


## Lab 8: Creating DHCP Client Reservations

**Video:** https://www.loom.com/share/1d9f10b8c231496b96479163a7348498

In this lab, we create DHCP client reservations for multiple network printers. We configure fixed IP addresses and MAC address bindings for LaserJet, KonicaColor, AcctPrinter, and SalesPrinter devices on the corporate network.

### Topics Covered:
- DHCP client reservation configuration
- MAC address binding
- Static IP assignment via DHCP
- Network printer device management
- Server Manager DHCP tool usage

## Lab 9: Created SOHO Network and Tested Connectivity

**Video:** https://www.loom.com/share/2b67e6842de34236a3f75682132cae31

In this lab, we set up a SOHO (Small Office Home Office) network topology. We connect the switch to the router and connect all other network nodes and devices to the switch using ethernet cables, then test connectivity.

### Topics Covered:
- SOHO network design
- Network topology setup
- Switch configuration
- Router connectivity
- Multi-device ethernet connectivity
- Network testing and verification
